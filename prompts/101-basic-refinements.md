For the next steps, let's do some basic refinements.

1. We have the live stats to the right of the Game Field. That's awesome. I'd like another box to the left of the left of the Game Field that shows the basic stats of the game such as:
   1. Game Cycles should be called "Year / Iteration" on-screen and shown on this left box.
   2. Number of Species that were generated / number of Species currently left alive
   3. Number of Life Forms for each Species that were created / born / are still alive / died.
2. Add the last date the game was updated the footer.
3. Create a running log of ALL events and activities that happen in the game. This will be a long list of events that will be updated every time something happens in the game. It should be scrollable. It should include any mass events of birth or death. Each thing that happens to a Life Form or Pair should be logged.
4. Draw square brackets around each Life Form and exclude the square brackets from use as a Life Form indicator.
5. Use a + to connect Bonded Pairs and any Offspring that are still bonded (only in their first 20% of life).
6. If it isn't too crazy, make the two side panels (left and right 10% each of the browser width and the rest of the width should be used by the Game Field. The scrolling log at the bottom of the game field should be 30% of the browser height and the rest of the height should be used by the Game Field. Please also make the left and right panels scollable vs. taking the entire height of the browser. Things should adjust if the user resizes the browser window.

That's enough to try and getting working for now. Please be sure to make all of the code changes and save the files. Create new files if needed.
